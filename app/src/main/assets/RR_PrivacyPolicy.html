<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Resotoration Robotics PRIVACY POLICY</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is part of the <a href="http://restorationrobotics.com/app-terms-of-service/"><span class="s2">Terms of Service</span></a> and describes how Restoration Robotics, Inc. (“Restoration Robotics” or “We”) gather, use and disclose information collected in connection with the Services (as defined in the Terms of Service).  Please read this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service before using the Services or submitting any information to Restoration Robotics. To access and use the Services you must agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Terms”).  Your use of the Services (or any part thereof, including a mobile application) constitutes your agreement to the Terms.  If you do not agree with the Terms you may not use the Services.  By using the Services on behalf of any third party you represent that you are an authorized representative of that third party and that your use of the Services represents such third party’s acceptance of the Terms.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Terms with initial capital letters that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given them in the Terms of Service.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 18. Restoration Robotics does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children in this age group without permission of the child’s parent or legal guardian. Restoration Robotics does not knowingly allow children to register with us, communicate with us, or use any of our online services. We request that these individuals do not provide any personal information through the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.  If you are a parent and become aware that your child has provided us with information, please contact us in accordance with the “Contacting Restoration Robotics” section below, and we will work with you to address this issue.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Information You Provide</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Restoration Robotics collects information when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, some areas of the Services may ask you to submit personal information, such as in order for you to benefit from participating from the Services, including name, email and physical addresses, location, age, telephone numbers, device information, photos and any information you provide when you register with or otherwise submit such information via the Services. You will be informed what information is required and what information is optional. We may combine the information you submit with other information we have collected from third parties or you, whether on- or offline, including, for example, your age or location.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Passive Information We Collect</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Restoration Robotics may also collect data concerning your use of the Services (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information), using various technologies. We and our third party service providers may passively collect information in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, through your browser, using tracking technologies, using flash cookies, IP address, and from your device (for example, collecting unique device identifiers or geolocation data from your mobile device).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>USE OF YOUR DATA</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Data Usage by Restoration Robotics</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Information we collect from you will be used to operate, maintain, improve, customize and provide the Services to you, and otherwise in accordance with the use descriptions specified on the Services at the time we collect such information.  Restoration Robotics also uses your information for the purposes for which you gave it to us. For example, if you have expressed an interest in a particular product or program offered on the Services, we will use your data to provide you with the requested information or service. We may also use such information to contact you regarding the Services and in some cases to make available offers from Restoration Robotics or third parties that are related to the Services (“Offers”).  If you do not wish to receive Offers, you may opt out of receiving such Offers using the opt-out mechanism we provide in connection with such Offers or by modifying your account settings.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We also may use your personal information and data concerning your use of the Services for analytics purposes. For example, we may use this data to determine which parts of our Services are of most interest to users, which parts are of least interest, and to modify the Services accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR DATA</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We may disclose your information with other Restoration Robotics affiliates, partners with whom we are jointly marketing a product or service, and vendors and service providers whom we have engaged to assist us in our business functions, for the purpose of enabling us to provide the Services to you and to make available the Offers described above as necessary for such parties to make available and fulfill such Offers. Our service providers may include providers who provide services such mobile application hosting, data analysis, infrastructure provision, and IT services. These entities are required to abide by this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We will also disclose your information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or other government authority (such as reporting safety information to the FDA); to investigate fraud; to protect your safety or the safety of others; when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to protect our rights or the rights of a third party who may be harmed by your activities; to enforce our Terms of Service; or to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. In addition, we may aggregate or anonymize information collected through the Services so that the information does not identify you. We may use or disclose aggregated, anonymized and other non-personally identifiable information for any purpose, including for research and marketing purposes, and our use and disclosure of such information is not subject to restriction..</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If Restoration Robotics, or the assets of Restoration Robotics related to the Services, is acquired by a third party, we will provide your information to the party acquiring Restoration Robotics or such assets and such acquirer will have the right to use and disclose such information subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Cookies</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Site may use cookies, local shared objects (LSOs) and other tracking technologies to identify users who have previously visited so the user is recognized upon return.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Local Shared Objects</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A LSO is a collection of data that a website running Adobe Flash can place on your hard drive to recognize a repeat visitor and store settings and other information. We may use Adobe Flash technology, which allows us to service you with more tailored information, facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Services, and collect and store information about your use of the Services.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you have provided us with personally identifiable information, e.g., through a registration or a request for certain materials, we may associate this personally identifiable information with information gathered through these tracking technologies. This allows us to offer increased personalization and functionality.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Do-not-track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites with which the browser communicates. The Services do not currently respond to these “do-not-track” signals.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Third Party Sites</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy are applicable only to the Services and other online or mobile elements of Services owned by Restoration Robotics. This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or web property (including, without limitation, any application) that is available through the Services or to which the Services contain a link. The availability of, or inclusion of a link to, any such site or property on the Services does not imply endorsement of it by us or by our affiliates.  You acknowledge that Restoration Robotics is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and you agree that Restoration Robotics is not responsible for the content of such websites. Your use of these other linked websites is subject to the respective terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked websites.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Social Media Plugins</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Services may use social media plugins (e.g. the Facebook, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit the Services, the operator of the social plugin can place a cookie on your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Services. If you are logged into the social media website (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google+) while using the Services, the social plugins allow that social media website to receive information that you have used the Services. The social plugins also allow the social media website to share information about your activities on the Services with other users of their social media website. For example, Facebook Social Plugins allows Facebook to show your Likes and comments on the Services to your Facebook friends. Restoration Robotics does not control any of the content from the social media plugins. For more information about social plugins from other social media websites, you should refer to those sites’ privacy and data sharing statements.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>SECURITY</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Restoration Robotics and its third party providers may employ procedural and technological security measures, consistent with industry practice.  Such measures are reasonably designed to protect your information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.  Restoration Robotics may use encryption, password protection, secure socket layers, internal restrictions and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your information. However, you provide your information to us at your own risk. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be lost, accessed without authorization, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with the Services is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us on the Services has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contacting Restoration Robotics” section below.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>RETENTION PERIOD</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law or to otherwise fulfill a legal obligation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">By utilizing the Services, you understand and acknowledge that certain options and services within the Services necessarily require the collection of personally identifiable information. Please note that if you no longer use the Services, we will not be able to remove your personally identifiable information from the databases of our affiliates with which we have already shared your information (i.e., as of the date that you no longer use the Services). However, we may be able to remove your personally identifiable information from our database. We will seek to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.</span></p>
