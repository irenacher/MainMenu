Women make up 40% of those experiencing hair loss. Hair loss can be devastating for a woman’s self image and emotional well-being. As with men, hair loss in women is most commonly genetic. However, in contrast to men, other causes of hair loss are much more prevalent in women.  Hair loss may be a short-term symptom of a triggering event such as stress, pregnancy, or the use of certain medications. In these situations, hair will often (although not always) grow back when the event has passed. Hair loss can also be caused by damage resulting from aggressive hair treatments or constant pulling (traction alopecia).  With genetic hair loss, unfortunately, the thinning will persist and hair loss can become a life-long struggle.
