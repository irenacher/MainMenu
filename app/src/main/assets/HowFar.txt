Many people seek a doctorâ€™s evaluation only after they have started to notice significant hair loss or after hearing comments about a visible bald spot.  In general, the earlier your hair loss is addressed the more effectively it can be treated. In particular, medical therapy is best started early. A hair transplant is usually recommended once the hair loss has progressed.  It is important to seek a medical evaluation to receive a diagnosis of your hair loss and better understand your treatment options- both medical and surgical.
