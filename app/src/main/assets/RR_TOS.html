You may not link to the Site or any portion of the Services (including linking to a specific portion of the Services or framing Content in any way) and you may not employ script searches or search results from the Site in a manner that results in the display of any Content on a third party website or elsewhere.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>The following additional terms also apply to any software you acquire from Google Play (or its successors) operated by Google, Inc. or one of its affiliates (“Google”) (such software, “Google Software”), in connection with any mobile application made available by us through Google Play.  To the extent of any conflict between (a) the </i><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/"><span class="s3"><i>Google Terms of Service</i></span></a><i> and the </i><a href="http://play.google.com/about/android-developer-policies.html"><span class="s3"><i>Google Play Business and Program Policies</i></span></a><i> or such other terms which Google designates as default end user license terms for Google Play (all of which together are referred to as the “Google Play Terms”), and (b) the other terms and conditions in these Terms of Service, the Google Play Terms shall apply with respect to your use of any Google Software that you acquire from Google Play.  Restoration Robotics and you hereby acknowledge that Google does not have any responsibility or liability related to compliance or non-compliance by Restoration Robotics or you (or any other user) under this Agreement or the Google Play Terms.</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Restoration Robotics will use reasonable efforts to provide the Services.  Any use of the Services, including any reliance upon or use any of the information therein, shall be at your sole risk.  The Services (including the Site and the Content) are provided “As Is” and “As Available” without warranty of any kind (all of which are hereby disclaimed), whether express, implied or statutory, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">in no event shall Restoration Robotics or any of its licensors or information providers (collectively, “Restoration Robotics Parties”) be liable to you or any user in connection with the services for any special, punitive, indirect, consequential or incidental damages or for loss of profits, revenue, use, or data, in each case arising under any theory, including under warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or other theory, even if such Restoration Robotics party is aware of or has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Restoration Robotics parties’ aggregate liability to you or to any third party claiming through you in connection with the use of the Services is limited to the greater of (i) the amounts, if any, you paid to us for the Services giving rise to the liability in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, and (ii) $100.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Services are controlled and operated from the United States of America and Restoration Robotics makes no representations that materials in the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Each country has specific laws, regulations and medical practices governing the communication of medical information and information about medical products on Internet. You should not construe anything on the Services as a promotion or solicitation for any product or for the use of any product that is not authorized by the laws and regulations of the country where you are located.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>INDEMNIFICATION</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You agree to indemnify and hold the Restoration Robotics Parties harmless from any claim or demand, including any and all losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, costs or expenses, causes of action, suits, proceedings, judgments, and awards, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, whether brought by third parties or otherwise, due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms and any use of the Services other than as expressly permitted in these Terms. The foregoing indemnity obligations will survive any termination of the Terms or your use of the Services.  Restoration Robotics may, at its own expense, assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, which will not excuse your indemnity obligations under this section. You agree not to settle any matter subject to the foregoing indemnification obligations without the express consent and approval of Restoration Robotics.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We may terminate these Terms, or terminate, suspend or restrict your access to the Services, in the event that you violate any of the Terms. Upon termination or suspension, your right to access the Site and use the Services will immediately cease. We may discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or part of the Services with or without notice. If your access to the Services is suspended or terminated by us you agree that you will not attempt to access the Services by any alias or other disguised or fraudulent identity or otherwise without our express prior written approval.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>VIOLATIONS AND COMPLAINTS</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Without limiting Restoration Robotics’ rights or remedies under these Terms or at law or in equity, Restoration Robotics may investigate complaints related to your use of the Services and alleged violations of these Terms and to take any action we deem necessary and appropriate in connection with such complaints and violations. Such action may include reporting any suspected activity that is in violation of these Terms or in violation of any law to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties. In addition, we may disclose any information necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities, including personal information, relating to such complaints and violations.  You agree that monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy to us for violations of the Terms and you consent to injunctive or other equitable relief for such violations.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>GENERAL</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You may not assign these Terms or otherwise transfer or sublicense any rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part; any attempt to do so shall be void.  We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement will continue in effect and remain fully enforceable.  You will comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances related to your use of the Services.  Except as expressly stated herein, the Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Restoration Robotics with respect to the Services, and the Terms supersede and replace all prior or contemporaneous communications, proposals, understandings or agreement, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Restoration Robotics with respect to the Services or the subject matter of these Terms.  Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by you and Restoration Robotics. Our failure to enforce our rights and remedies available to us with respect your breach of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such breach nor of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision of these Terms.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">These Terms, and any claim, cause of action or dispute (“claim”) arising out of or related to these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the state of California regardless of your country of origin or where you access the Services. At Restoration Robotics’ request, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims. Notwithstanding the above, you agree that Restoration Robotics shall still be allowed to apply for and obtain injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the potential award is reasonably likely to be $10,000 or less, either you or us may elect to have the dispute resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event such arbitration is requested, such arbitration shall be conducted through a reputable alternative dispute resolution provider mutually agreed upon by you and us. The arbitration must be conducted in compliance with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>NOTICE AND CONTACT</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Any notices given by you under these Terms shall be given in writing or by email and shall be delivered to the following address:</span></p>
