Hair loss is a significant concern for many people. The average person sheds anywhere from 50 to 100 hairs a day, an undetectable amount compared to the roughly 100,000 to 150,000 hairs on your head. Common genetic hair loss causes a gradual thinning of hair in the temples and crown. If you suddenly notice significantly more hair in your comb or on your pillow, it may also be an early sign of balding. 

Hair loss can have many causes including genetics, aging, and a number of other influences such as medication, physical or emotional stress, thyroid problems, skin infections, or excessive hormones. When you are experiencing hair loss, your first step should always be to obtain an accurate diagnosis by a qualified physician.  Androgenetic alopecia, commonly called male or female pattern baldness, is hair loss caused by a genetic sensitivity of certain hair follicles to the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Over time, DHT causes these susceptible hair follicles to shrivel (miniaturize) and eventually dissappear.  Initially noticed as hair thinning, the process may eventually lead to areas that are completely bald.

Men and women will usually have a different biochemical response to DHT, and this causes both the pattern and the extent of the hair loss to be different between the sexes. The majority of women with androgenic alopecia have diffuse thinning on all areas of the scalp. Men, on the other hand, will rarely have diffuse thinning but instead have more distinct patterns of baldness.
