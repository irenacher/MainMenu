Statistics show that one in four men are currently experiencing hair loss. By age 35, over 60% of American men will have some degree of appreciable hair loss and by age 50, about 85% of men have significantly thinning hair. For most men, hair begins to recede at the temples/forehead or the crown. Healthy hair follicles that are resistant to DHT usually remain around the sides and back of the head, but may eventually become weaker and finer. Hair loss can lead to psychological, social, and professional consequences.  It is important to see a physician experienced in hair loss so that you can be properly evaluated and have your treatment options explained.â€¨
